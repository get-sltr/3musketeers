## 🔧 Known Issues & Edge Cases

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking for demo):
1. **Typing indicator clearing**: Sometimes persists after user stops typing
   - **Impact:** Low - visual only
   - **Fix ETA:** 15 minutes

2. **Message reload delay**: 1.5s delay to ensure backend saves messages
   - **Impact:** Low - messages still appear, just slight delay
   - **Note:** This is a workaround; proper fix would be to use socket acknowledgments

3. **Placeholder images**: Some profiles use `via.placeholder.com` (may fail to load)
   - **Impact:** Low - only affects demo data
   - **Fix:** Use actual uploaded photos or different placeholder service

### Critical for Production (Post-demo):
1. Block/Report should save to database (currently localStorage)
2. Push notifications for messages
3. Image optimization/compression
4. Rate limiting on API calls
5. Email verification
