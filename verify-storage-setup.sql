-- Storage Buckets & Policies Verification
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to verify Step 3 implementation

-- =====================================================
-- 1. CHECK STORAGE BUCKETS
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  public,
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN public THEN 'üåê PUBLIC'
    ELSE 'üîí PRIVATE'
  END as access_type
FROM storage.buckets
WHERE id IN ('photos', 'avatars', 'files')
ORDER BY id;

-- =====================================================
-- 2. CHECK STORAGE POLICIES (DETAILED)
-- =====================================================

  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  CASE 
    WHEN cmd = 'SELECT' THEN 'üîç READ'

    ELSE cmd
  END as operation,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'storage'
AND tablename = 'objects'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- =====================================================
-- 3. POLICY COUNT BY BUCKET
-- =====================================================

-- Count policies by bucket (extracted from policy names)
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN policyname LIKE '%Photos%' THEN 'photos'
    WHEN policyname LIKE '%Avatars%' THEN 'avatars'

    WHEN policyname LIKE '%Avatars%' THEN 'avatars'
    WHEN policyname LIKE '%files%' THEN 'files'
    ELSE 'other'
  END, cmd
ORDER BY bucket_name, cmd;

-- =====================================================
-- 4. EXPECTED VS ACTUAL STORAGE POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Expected storage policies

-- 5. STORAGE SETUP SUMMARY
-- =====================================================
