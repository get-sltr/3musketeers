**Purpose:** Track daily updates, completed work, and progress to avoid repeating tasks.

**Last Updated:** Friday, October 31, 2025 at 05:23 PM

## 🤖 AUTOMATION INSTRUCTIONS

### Quick Commands:
- `npm run log:new` - Create today's log entry automatically
- `npm run log:check` - Check if today's log entry exists
- `npm run log:remind` - Show reminder to update log

### Automated Daily Reminder:
You can set up a daily reminder by adding to your crontab (macOS/Linux):
```bash
# Run daily at 9 AM to check/remind
0 9 * * * cd /Users/lastud/Desktop/3musketeers && npm run log:check
```

### Git Hook (Optional):
A git hook can be set up to remind you before commits. See `.git/hooks/pre-commit.example`

---

## 📅 HOW TO USE

1. **Start your day**: Run `npm run log:new` to create today's entry
2. **During work**: Update the sections below as you work
3. **End of day**: Fill in completed tasks and note what's in progress

**Pro Tip:** Run `npm run log:new` at the start of each work session!

## 🚀 AUTO-OPEN PROJECT FILES

### Automatic File Opening (Recommended)
These files should auto-open when you open the project:
- **DAILY_LOG.md** (this file)
- **CURSOR_BUILD_GUIDE.md** 
- **src/app/.cursorrules** (Cursor AI rules)

### Setup Auto-Open:
1. Run `npm run open:files` once to open all files
2. **Pin each tab** in Cursor (Right-click tab → "Pin Tab")
3. Files will now auto-restore every time you open the project!

### Manual Opening:
- `npm run open:files` - Open all essential files at once
