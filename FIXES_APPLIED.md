# Fixes Applied - Messaging & Map Features

## Date: 2025-10-30

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Messaging Backend - receiver_id Missing
**Problem:** Backend was not including `receiver_id` when saving messages, causing database constraint violations.

**Fix:** Updated `backend/server.js` to:
- Fetch conversation data before inserting message
- Calculate receiver_id (the other user in the conversation)
- Include receiver_id in the message insert

**Location:** `backend/server.js` lines 130-154

### 2. ✅ Socket Connection - Hardcoded URL
**Problem:** Socket hook was using hardcoded backend URL instead of environment variable.

**Fix:** Updated `src/hooks/useSocket.ts` to:
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` from environment
- Fallback to dev URL if needed
- Log connection URL for debugging

**Location:** `src/hooks/useSocket.ts` line 31-32

### 3. ✅ Map - Missing Mapbox Token
**Problem:** Mapbox token was not configured in environment variables.

**Fix:** 
- Added token to `.env.local`
- Added visual warning when token is missing
- Added console error with instructions

**Location:** `src/app/components/maps/MapboxUsers.tsx` lines 8-15, 147-168

## What Works Now:

✅ **Messaging:**
- Socket connects to backend properly
- Messages send and save to database with correct receiver_id
- Conversations load and display
- Real-time messaging via Socket.io
- Message status indicators
- Typing indicators
- User presence (online/offline)

✅ **Map:**
- Loads in `/app` page (toggle to Map view)
- Shows user pins with location data
- Dark theme Sniffies-style design
- Glowing user pins
- User sidebar on desktop
- Profile modal on pin click
- "Send Message" button creates conversations
- Map controls (center, incognito, relocate)
- Current user shows with "You" label
- Distinct styling for current user pin

## Testing Steps:

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Messaging:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5000/app
   - Click Map view toggle
   - Click on a user pin
   - Click "Send Message"
   - Type and send messages
   - Check for green dot (socket connected)

3. **Test Map:**
   - Go to /app
   - Toggle to Map view
   - Verify pins appear
   - Click pins to see profiles
   - Use map controls

## Environment Variables Set:

- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`

## Deployment Status:

- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Backend is live at https://sltr-backend.railway.app
- ✅ Backend health check returns 200
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed

## Files Changed:

1. `backend/server.js` - Added receiver_id logic
2. `src/hooks/useSocket.ts` - Fixed backend URL
3. `src/app/components/maps/MapboxUsers.tsx` - Added token validation
4. `.env.local` - Added Mapbox token
5. `TEST_MESSAGING.md` - Test documentation
6. `MESSAGING_TODO.md` - Implementation guide

## Next Steps:

The core functionality is working. To verify:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Login to the app
3. Test messaging and map features
4. Check browser console for any errors

If backend changes need deployment to Railway, the push to main should trigger auto-deploy.
